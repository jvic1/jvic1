Hello, my name is Juan. I am not a developer but a finance nerd 8). I learnt python with the purpose of improving my financial analysis skills, so the little projects I'll be creating and sharing will focus on using python to help financial analysis of stocks.

Little projects like calculating betas for the CAPM, normalization of prices, portfolio optimization, etc. will be regular subjects for my little projects

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope it can help you in some way

have a good one

-Juan
